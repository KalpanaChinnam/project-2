            <ul type=disc>
                <li>Boil the drinking water and allow to cool slightly for 2-3 mins, this slightly cooler water will get
                    the best out
                    of your delicate tea leaves.</li>
                <li>Pour the water onto the teabag to release its delicious aroma.</li>
                <li>Leave the teabag to infuse for up to 3 minutes. If you like a stronger taste you can brew a little
                    longer but watch
                    out, over brewing can cause bitterness.</li>
                <li>Remove the teabag and enjoy your deliciously refreshing Lipton Green Tea!</li>
            </ul>
            <b>tip:</b> allow to cool and add ice to enjoy a DIY Lipton Iced Green Tea on a hot day!

            <b>Idly</b>
            <ul type=disc>
                <li>Soak the rice and urad dal in separate bowls for at least 4 hours. These will be later ground
                    together to make a batter which ferments for 6 hours or more.</li>
                <li>Grind the soaked items separately. This is best done with a stone grinder, but a high powered
                    blender can also do the job (although the batter will be somewhat more coarse in texture).</li>
                <li>Mix the ground rice and urad dal together.
                </li>
                <li>Set aside in a warm place to ferment for 8 hours. Use a crock pot on the "keep warm" setting or an
                    oven on the "proof" setting if you live in an area where the ambient temperature is below 75 °F (24
                    °C).</li>
                <li>Add salt.</li>
                <li>Oil the idli steamer plates.</li>
                <li>Spoon the batter into the plates.</li>
                <li>Set the idli steamer into a large, pre heated pot with water in the bottom for steaming.</li>
                <li>Steam the batter for 5-10 minutes or until fluffy.</li>
                <li>Remove the idlis from the steamer and serve warm with Chutney, or Sambhar.</li>
            </ul>
